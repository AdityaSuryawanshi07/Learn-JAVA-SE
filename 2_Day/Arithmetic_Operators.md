# Arithmetic Operators
### Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric operands

1. Addition Operator (+):
   The addition operator is represented by the symbol "+" and is used to add two operands together.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   int result = a + b;  // result = 8
   ```

2. Subtraction Operator (-):
   The subtraction operator is represented by the symbol "-" and is used to subtract the second operand from the first.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 10;
   int b = 4;
   int result = a - b;  // result = 6
   ```

3. Multiplication Operator (*):
   The multiplication operator is represented by the symbol "*" and is used to multiply two operands.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 3;
   int b = 5;
   int result = a * b;  // result = 15
   ```

4. Division Operator (/):
   The division operator is represented by the symbol "/" and is used to divide the first operand by the second.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 10;
   int b = 2;
   int result = a / b;  // result = 5
   ```

   It's important to note that if both operands of the division operator are integers, the result will also be an integer, discarding any decimal part. To perform floating-point division, you can use operands of type `double` or `float`.

5. Modulus Operator (%):
   The modulus operator is represented by the symbol "%" and returns the remainder of the division operation.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 10;
   int b = 3;
   int result = a % b;  // result = 1
   ```

6. Unary Operators:
   - Unary Plus Operator (+): It is used to indicate the positive value of an operand. For example: `int a = +5;`
   - Unary Minus Operator (-): It negates the value of an operand. For example: `int a = -5;`

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int result1 = +a;  // result1 = 5
   int result2 = -a;  // result2 = -5
   ```

These arithmetic operators can be used with different numeric types, such as `int`, `double`, `float`, `long`, etc. They allow you to perform various calculations and manipulate numeric values in your Java programs.
