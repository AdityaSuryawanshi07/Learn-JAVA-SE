# Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They allow you to store and update the values of variables based on the result of an expression. Here are the assignment operators available in Java:

1. Simple Assignment Operator (=):
   The simple assignment operator is represented by the symbol "=" and is used to assign the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 10;
   ```

2. Addition Assignment Operator (+=):
   The addition assignment operator is represented by the symbol "+=" and is used to add the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side and assign the result to the variable.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 5;
   x += 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x + 3; // x = 8
   ```

3. Subtraction Assignment Operator (-=):
   The subtraction assignment operator is represented by the symbol "-=" and is used to subtract the value on the right-hand side from the variable on the left-hand side and assign the result to the variable.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 10;
   x -= 4;  // Equivalent to: x = x - 4; // x = 6
   ```

4. Multiplication Assignment Operator (*=):
   The multiplication assignment operator is represented by the symbol "*=" and is used to multiply the value on the right-hand side with the variable on the left-hand side and assign the result to the variable.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 3;
   x *= 2;  // Equivalent to: x = x * 2; // x = 6
   ```

5. Division Assignment Operator (/=):
   The division assignment operator is represented by the symbol "/=" and is used to divide the variable on the left-hand side by the value on the right-hand side and assign the result to the variable.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 10;
   x /= 5;  // Equivalent to: x = x / 5; // x = 2
   ```

6. Modulus Assignment Operator (%=):
   The modulus assignment operator is represented by the symbol "%=" and is used to perform modulus operation on the variable on the left-hand side with the value on the right-hand side and assign the result to the variable.

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 10;
   x %= 3;  // Equivalent to: x = x % 3; // x = 1
   ```
