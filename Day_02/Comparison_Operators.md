# Comparison Operators

Comparison Operators are used to compare two values or expressions and return a boolean result (true or false) based on the comparison. These operators allow you to check the relationship between values. Here are the comparison operators available in Java:

1. Equality Operator (==):
   The equality operator is represented by "==" and checks if the values of two operands are equal. If the values are equal, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a == b);  // result = false
   ```

2. Inequality Operator (!=):
   The inequality operator is represented by "!=" and checks if the values of two operands are not equal. If the values are not equal, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a != b);  // result = true
   ```

3. Greater Than Operator (>):
   The greater than operator is represented by ">" and checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If it is true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a > b);  // result = true
   ```

4. Less Than Operator (<):
   The less than operator is represented by "<" and checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If it is true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a < b);  // result = false
   ```

5. Greater Than or Equal To Operator (>=):
   The greater than or equal to operator is represented by ">=" and checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If it is true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a >= b);  // result = true
   ```

6. Less Than or Equal To Operator (<=):
   The less than or equal to operator is represented by "<=" and checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If it is true, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

   Example:
   ```java
   int a = 5;
   int b = 3;
   boolean result = (a <= b);  // result = false
   ```
