# Increment and Decrement Operators

Increment and Decrement Operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1. These operators can be used with both integer and floating-point types. Here are the increment and decrement operators available in Java:

1. Increment Operator (++):
   The increment operator is represented by "++" and is used to increase the value of a variable by 1. It can be used as a prefix (++x) or postfix (x++).

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 5;
   x++;  // Post-increment: x = x + 1;
   ++x;  // Pre-increment: x = x + 1;
   ```

2. Decrement Operator (--):
   The decrement operator is represented by "--" and is used to decrease the value of a variable by 1. It can be used as a prefix (--x) or postfix (x--).

   Example:
   ```java
   int x = 5;
   x--;  // Post-decrement: x = x - 1;
   --x;  // Pre-decrement: x = x - 1;
   ```

The increment and decrement operators can be applied to variables of numeric types, such as int, long, float, and double. They are commonly used in loops and other situations where you need to manipulate the value of a variable by incrementing or decrementing it.
