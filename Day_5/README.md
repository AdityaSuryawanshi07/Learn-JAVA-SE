### Java for Loop
1. Java for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. The syntax of for loop is:
<br><br>
for (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {<br>
    // body of the loop<br>
}<br>
<br><br>
Here,

* The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
* The condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the body of the for loop is executed.
* The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression.
* The condition is evaluated again. The process continues until the condition is false.

### Assignment 
  1. Java Program to Display Alphabets (A to Z) using loop
  2. Java Program to Count Number of Digits in an Integer
  3. Java Program to Reverse a Number
  4. Program to print half pyramid using alphabets<br>
      A<br>
      B B<br>
      C C C<br>
      D D D D<br>
      E E E E E<br>
   5. Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input is 12345, the output should be 54321.
   6. Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.
   7. Write a do-while loop that asks the user to enter two numbers. The numbers should be added and the sum displayed. The loop should ask the user whether he or she wishes to perform the operation again. If so, the           loop should repeat; otherwise it should terminate. 
   8. Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
       1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n 
   9. Write a program to print following :<br>
