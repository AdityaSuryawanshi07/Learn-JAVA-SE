# Operators
In Java, operators are symbols that perform specific operations on one or more operands (variables, literals, or expressions) and produce a result. Java supports a wide range of operators that can be categorized into several types:[I'm an inline-style link]([https://www.google.com](https://github.com/Pankaj-Str/Learn-JAVA-SE/blob/main/Day_2/Arithmetic_Operators.md)

    1. Arithmetic Operators:
        +: Addition operator. Adds two operands.
        -: Subtraction operator. Subtracts the second operand from the first.
        ****: Multiplication operator. Multiplies two operands.
        /: Division operator. Divides the first operand by the second.
        %: Modulus operator. Returns the remainder of the division operation.

    2. Assignment Operators:
        =: Simple assignment operator. Assigns a value to a variable.
        +=: Addition assignment operator. Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
        -=: Subtraction assignment operator. Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
        ****=**: Multiplication assignment operator. Multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
        /=: Division assignment operator. Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.
        %=: Modulus assignment operator. Performs modulus on the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

    3. Comparison Operators:
        ==: Equality operator. Checks if two operands are equal.
        !=: Inequality operator. Checks if two operands are not equal.
        >: Greater than operator. Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
        <: Less than operator. Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
        >=: Greater than or equal to operator. Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
        <=: Less than or equal to operator. Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

    4. Logical Operators:
        &&: Conditional AND operator. Returns true if both operands are true.
        ||: Conditional OR operator. Returns true if either operand is true.
        !: Logical NOT operator. Negates the value of the operand.

    5. Increment and Decrement Operators:
        ++: Increment operator. Increments the value of the operand by 1.
        --: Decrement operator. Decrements the value of the operand by 1.

    6. Bitwise Operators:
        &: Bitwise AND operator. Performs bitwise AND on the binary representations of the operands.
        |: Bitwise OR operator. Performs bitwise OR on the binary representations of the operands.
        ^: Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. Performs bitwise XOR on the binary representations of the operands.
        ~: Bitwise complement operator. Flips the bits of the operand.
        <<: Left shift operator. Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number of positions specified by the right operand.
        >>: Right shift operator. Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand.
        >>>: Unsigned right shift operator. Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number of positions specified by the right operand, and fills the leftmost bits with zeros.

These are some of the commonly used operators in Java. Each operator has its own precedence and associativity rules, which determine the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. By using operators effectively, you can perform various calculations, comparisons, and logical operations in your Java programs.
