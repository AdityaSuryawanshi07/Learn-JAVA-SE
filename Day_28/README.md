### Java enum Class

### Java enum String

An enum (short for "enumeration") is a special data type used to define a set of named constant values. Enumerations are often used to represent a fixed set of related constants, such as days of the week, months, or status codes, in a more structured and type-safe way. Enum constants are implicitly final and can't be changed after they are defined.

Here's how you can declare and use an enum class in Java:

```java
public enum Day {
    SUNDAY,    // Enum constants (implicitly public static final)
    MONDAY,
    TUESDAY,
    WEDNESDAY,
    THURSDAY,
    FRIDAY,
    SATURDAY
}

public class EnumExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Accessing enum constants
        Day today = Day.WEDNESDAY;

        // Switch statement with enum
        switch (today) {
            case MONDAY:
                System.out.println("It's Monday!");
                break;
            case WEDNESDAY:
                System.out.println("It's Wednesday!");
                break;
            // ... other cases ...
            default:
                System.out.println("It's not a special day.");
        }

        // Enum values() method to iterate through all constants
        Day[] daysOfWeek = Day.values();
        for (Day day : daysOfWeek) {
            System.out.println(day);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We define an `enum` class called `Day`, which represents the days of the week as enum constants. Enum constants are typically written in uppercase letters.

- In the `EnumExample` class, we access the enum constants and use them in a `switch` statement to print a message based on the current day.

- The `values()` method of the enum is used to retrieve an array of all enum constants, allowing you to iterate through them.

Enums are especially useful when you need a fixed set of related values and want to ensure type safety. They also provide a clear and concise way to represent and work with such constants in your code.
